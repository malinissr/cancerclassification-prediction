# cancerclassification-prediction
The main objective of the project was to build various models and compare their performance based on accuracy.
Built models trained on logistic regression, SVM, K-nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes classifier.
By comparing the prediction accuracy of these models, it was found that model trained on logistic regression performed the best in classifying the dataset.
